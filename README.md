Flood Prediction Using Machine Learning
Problem Statement:
Natural disasters like floods cause immense damage to life and property. Early prediction and timely alerts are crucial to mitigate their impact. This project aims to leverage machine learning to predict potential flood scenarios and enable proactive disaster management.

Proposed Solution:
1) Prediction Module
Approach 1: Historical Rainfall-Based Prediction
We utilize a historical dataset containing rainfall measurements over several years along with flood occurrence labels for specific regions (states/cities). The dataset spans approximately three months per year.

Rainfall data is segmented into 10-day intervals, and average values for each interval are computed.

These averaged values serve as input features, while flood occurrence (yes/no) becomes the target variable.

A binary classification model is then trained using simple ML algorithms like logistic regression.

The model can predict the likelihood of a flood given rainfall data for any 10-day window.

As a baseline solution, this method can be enhanced by including additional parameters such as terrain type, geographic location, and other environmental factors to improve accuracy and reliability.

Approach 2: Real-Time Monitoring via Web Scraping
We also propose using data from india-water.gov.in, an official government portal that updates water level statuses in various regions using color-coded alerts:

Yellow: Above Normal Flood

Orange: Severe Flood

Red: Extreme Flood

We plan to scrape this real-time data and maintain it in a structured database for continuous monitoring and analysis.

2) Alert System
Once potential flood conditions are detected, either via model prediction or scraped alert data, a red alert message will be sent to residents in the affected region. This can be achieved using publicly available SMS services to broadcast warnings, helping minimize risk and ensure timely evacuation.
